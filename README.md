## Project Motivation

Our main motivation is to define the primary factors that prevent students from attending college especially those high school seniors who expressed an interest in pursuing their higher education. We aims to empower school counselors by providing them with a helpful tool that will help them better assist the students and identify the students who might be at risk of not pursuing their dreams so they can take the necessary procedures and help them. \### Group 4
